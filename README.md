### Congratulations!

Youâ€™ve been commissioned to build SupaHotFire: a user interface for keeping records of famous rappers. Grand Hustle records will use this user interface as a way to view their database of rappers.

### Create an application that does the following:

- Displays a table of Rappers on pageload, populated by the API.
- Has a form to add new Rappers to the database.
- Add another feature that incorporates the API in some way.

### Guidelines

- Use React or Vue to construct the UI. React is supported out-of-the-box.
- Using a flux architecture library such as Redux is optional.
- You may import whatever libraries you wish.
- You may style the project however you wish (CSS, SCSS, CSS-in-JS, etc...).
- Have fun!

### Set-up instructions

This project implements [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Visit `/api/rappers` to see the REST endpoint for the rappers resource.

All project code should be placed within the `src/` directory. Any code changes within this directory will trigger a rebuild.
